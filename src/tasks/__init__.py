    Registration of tasks in the scheduler, to avoid various kinds of errors.
    Please note that if your task will be repeated very oftenâ€”this can slow down the bot,
    in this case you need to run the scheduler in a separate thread (that is, run separately from the bot)

    example:
        scheduler.add_jon(my_job, "interval", seconds=30)
